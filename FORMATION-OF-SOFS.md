# FORMATION OF SOFS

# INTRODUCTION

Special operations forces (SOFs) appeared in the international media in the 1970s. Hijackings of airplanes by terrorists and other hostage crises pulled these clandestine units out of the shadows. Since then, SOFs have gained a reputation for daring counterterrorism operations. In fact, terrorism is not the cause of the rise of SOFs. Modern-day SOFs appeared at the onset of the Second World War. Since then they have constituted an integral part of the transformation of modern warfare. In recent conflicts, SOFs succeeded the infantry and other land army units and established themselves as the core organ of land warfare.

Placing SOFs in the broader discussions on military power and military innovations, I will first offer a new conceptualization of this branch. Next, I will

hostage rescues and placed them on the path to their current fame [(Connelly and Willcox 2005)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/ILFB).

# AMBIGUOUS CONCEPTS

In this section, I will introduce and discuss two ambiguous concepts which are central for the arguments in the paper. The first is special operations forces in the second is military innovations

## SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES

Many concepts suffer from inconsistencies, fuzzy boundaries, and overlaps. However, the terminology that pertains to the special operations forces is uniquely obscure. The literature offers several alternative labels for these units: Irregular Fighters, Commandos, Elite Units, Special Forces and most prominently Special Operations Forces. The costly stalemate of WWI sent the fighting militaries on frantic searches for tiebreakers.

# THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

פעולות מיוחדות אינן תופעה חדשה.

Clandestine missions have always been part of warfare. Due to their deceptive nature, the operations and the individuals who carried them out were notorious. When militaries had to resort to such inglorious operations they often relegated them to mercenaries or to second-rate soldiers [(Arquilla 2011, page 5; Boot 2013, page 23)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/dcg0+dBg6/?locator=5,23).

## WWI

The precursors of the commandos appeared in World War I.

By 1914, technologies such as machine guns and fragmentation shells had matured. Every country that took part in the war either developed or acquired these technologies. The combating nations found themselves caught in static trench warfare. The costly stalemate sent the fighting militaries on frantic searches for tiebreakers. Late in the summer of 1915, Captain Willy Martin Rohr took over the command of Germany’s seminal Assault Detachment. Encouraged by his commander, Lieutenant Colonel Max Bauer, Rohr searched for quick solutions. Within a few weeks, he developed a new tactic. Assisted by a flame throwers unit, Rohr led small teams out of their trenches, infiltrated the enemy’s, and wreaked havoc in their midst [(Shunk 2010; Gudmundsson 1995)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/PRPI+1Les). Rohr’s superiors invited him to develop a course in which he taught his method to other German units. This maneuver provided the foundation for the formation of the Shock Troops that enabled Germany and its allies to break out of the trenches [(Gudmundsson 1995)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/1Les). Other militaries, most notably the Canadian and Italian forces, developed similar infiltration tactics and introduced them at later stages of the war.

The advanced the idea that technological dominance is the key to amassing military power and in consequence secure victories.

However, when Stephen Biddle put this notion to a test, using WWI as his main case study, the findings did not support the hypothesis. Hence, he offered an alternative hypothesis. Biddle maintained that battlefield success relies not only on technological advantages but also on the their effective employment in the battlefield.
Although he did not refer specifically to special operations forces, his argument is essential for understanding their rise and proliferation.

and the mechanization of the battlefield posed unprecedented challenges to traditional military formations, most notably the infantry and the cavalry. Both became increasingly vulnerable and decreasingly effective.

## WWII

The unceasing technological breakthroughs during and after The First World War earned the era with the title ‘The Second Industrial Revolution.’ The tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, and heavy bombers that evolved during those years raised the stakes of each military confrontation. Military intelligence agencies expanded and became increasingly attentive to technological changes in rival armed forces. However, gathering intelligence regarding enemies’ capabilities, let alone plans, was an arduous challenge.

Using Farrell's terminology the infantry adapted in response to the major technological innovations that appeared on the battlefield [(Farrell 2013; Murray 1998)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/lrsk+jM3M)

Signit

On May 10, 1940, Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg method enabled the Wehrmacht to take full advantage of its potential power, and within a matter of days, Germany devastated the French defense lines. By the late spring, the German war machine seemed unstoppable. After swiftly occupying most of Western Europe it forced Britain to prepare for a fight over the homeland.

SOE July 22

Newly appointed Prime-Minister Churchill and his close military aides, shared an appreciation for ingenuity and with their backs against the wall, were open to experimentation. Twenty-four hours after the conclusion of ‘Operation Dynamo’ - the evacuation of the allied soldiers from the German besieged shores of Dunkirk in Northern France - Lieutenant General Sir John Dill, Chief of the General Staff, presented Churchill with a plan that came from the desk of his recently appointed assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Wrangel Clarke.

UK as early as 1940, only several days after Britain concluded the evacuation of its forces from Dunkirk.

## MILITARY INNOVATIONS

The constant change in the nature of war over the course of the twentieth century has drawn scholarly attention to the concepts of military innovations, adaptations, and diffusion. Seminal works in the field corresponded with the perspective that equated technological innovations with greater battlefield effectiveness [(Posen 1984; Evangelista 1988)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/3by6+w2Mv). The “modern system” thesis, according to which battlefield efficiency depends not only on technological advantages but also on how such advantages are used, broadened the scope of the term innovations [(Biddle 2004)](https://paperpile.com/c/AjC4jq/cImI). and underscored the significance of strategic and organizational innovations

METHOD

## METHOD

The literature leads to the conclusion that the cycle of military innovations and adaptations is continuous. The adoption of new technology by one actor generates a chain reaction. Assuming that the innovation is known to all actors, both the adopting army and its adversaries would assess its potential consequences and undergo processes of organizational and doctrinal adaptations. The adopting army would aim at maximizing the effects of the new technology while the adversary would try to mitigate them.

# DATA

Testing the hypothesis required an extensive collection of data. The unit of analysis in the first database is each individual military unit that met the aforementioned criteria of a special operations force.

Comparison between units that specialize in conventional warfare and units that specialize in low-intensity conflicts.

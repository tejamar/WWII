### BACKGROUND

Special operations forces _(SOFs)_ appeared in the international media in the 1970s. Hijackings of airplanes by terrorists and other hostage crises drew these clandestine units out of the shadows. Since then, SOFs have gained a reputation for daring counterterrorism operations. 

In fact, terrorism is not the cause for the rise of SOFs. Modern-day SOFs appeared at the onset of the Second World War. Since then they have constituted an integral part of the **transformation of modern warfare**. 

Indeed, in recent conflicts, SOFs have gradually replaced the infantry and other land army units and established themselves as the core branch of land warfare.

The rise of SOFs to prominence is far from obvious. Clandestine missions have always been part of warfare. Due to their deceptive nature, the operations and the individuals who carried them out were notorious. When militaries had to resort to such inglorious operations they often relegated them to mercenaries or to second-rate soldiers [ British commandos 1940 were second rate] 

The unceasing technological breakthroughs during and after WWI earned the era with the title ‘The Second Industrial Revolution.’ The tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, and heavy bombers that evolved during those years raised the stakes of each confrontation. 

As a result, military intelligence agencies had expanded and became increasingly attentive to technological changes in rival armed forces. However, gathering intelligence regarding enemies’ capabilities, let alone plans, was an arduous challenge.

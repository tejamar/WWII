### PROJECT BACKGROUND

Special operations forces _(SOFs)_ had gained increasing prominence since the 1970s. When terrorists began to hijack civilian  airplanes, these clandestine units came out of the shadows and became synonymous with counterterrorism operations. Yet, terrorism was not the cause for the appearance of SOFs. 

Modern-day SOFs appeared at the onset of the Second World War as a result of the unceasing technological breakthroughs during and after WWI which earned the era with the title **The Second Industrial Revolution**. The tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, and heavy bombers that evolved during those years, along with the increasing prominence of signal and visual intelligence transfomed the core elements of warfare and militaries. 

On May 10, Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg method enabled Germany to take full advantage of its potential power, and within a matter of days, the Wehrmacht devastated the defense lines of the allies. 

At that time, the German war machine seemed unstoppable. It had swiftly occupied most of Western Europe and forced Britain to prepare to defend its homeland (Rankin 2009, page 247; Seymour 1985, page 7) 

Prime Minister Churchill and Sir John Dill, Chief of the General Staff, searched for ways to slow down the Wehrmacht’s advance. Both men valued ingenuity and so were open to an unorthodox idea that Dill’s assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, presented.

Clarke gathered that the Wehrmacht’s rapid occupation of Western Europe presented the German military with considerable challenges. Hitler and his generals needed every combat unit to further their advancements in North Africa and the Mediterranean and, even more importantly, to prepare for their attack on the Soviet Union. Now, they also had to maintain their grip on Europe. The Wehrmacht’s command had reassigned combat units from the front lines to the defense of thousands of miles of coastline in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France and the repression of popular uprisings in these countries.

Clarke’s plan was to use the powerful Royal Navy to deliver small teams of capable soldiers to the scarcely protected shores of Continental Western Europe. Unlike the large-scale amphibious landings, such as Invasion of Normandy, which became rampant at later stages of the war, the missions of these seminal teams were clandestine. They included galvanizing local resistance, gathering intelligence, and harassing the Germans.

Clarke believed that an effective guerilla campaign would weaken the overtaxed German military by forcing it to commit additional resources and troops to the task of tightening its grip over the occupied countries (Leebaert 2009, page 452-3; Tucker and Lamb 2007, page 146).

On June 3rd 1940 Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote to the Chief of Staff:

> The completely defensive habit of mind, which has ruined the French, must not be allowed to ruin all our initiative. It is of the highest consequence to keep the largest numbers of German forces all along the coasts of the countries that have been conquered, and we should immediately set to work to organise raiding forces on these coasts where the populations are friendly. Such forces might be composed by self-contained, thoroughly equipped units of say 1,000 up to not less than 10,000 when combined.

Two days later he added:

> Enterprises must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class, who can develop a reign of terror first of all on the 'butcher and bolt' policy. I look to the Chiefs of Staff to propose me measures for a vigorous, enterprising and ceaseless offensive against the whole German occupied coastline.

Several days after he received Churchill’s blessing, Clarke established a new section of the **Secretariat of Military Operations**. His first recruits were nothing like what he had envisioned. Quite often, the only available candidates were soldiers who were considered non-essential or even problematic by their former commanders. To aggravate things even further, the pressing circumstances forced the new units to launch their first operations almost immediately. Not surprisingly, their initial attacks failed (Thomas 1983). 

Nonetheless, rumors about a new clandestine branch spread rapidly and captivated the imaginations of soldiers in other units. 
By the end of 1940, the number of commando units stood at sixteen. They clustered in five battalions of the **Special Service Brigade**. Each unit had a specific role that matched the challenges that different enemies and terrains presented. 

Distinctive roles and theaters of operation were not the only characteristics that distinguished the units; they also varied by the ways they formed and evolved. While Clarke initiated the commando units from his headquarters in London, officers in different theaters of war independently formed special units to cope with the unique challenges that they faced. 

For example, as early as June 1940, Major Ralph A. Bagnold formed the Long Range Desert Group (LRDP) in Egypt. The unit that specialized in reconnaissance and raids quickly gained a reputation as a highly professional and effective force. A month later, Roger Courtney established the Special Boat Section, which evolved into the Special Boat Service. In early December 1940 and Orde Wingate introduced the Gideon Force in Ethiopia.

Since then they have constituted an integral part of the **transformation of modern warfare**. Indeed, in recent conflicts, SOFs have gradually replaced the infantry and other land army units and established themselves as the core branch of land warfare.

The rise of SOFs to prominence is far from obvious. Clandestine missions have always been part of warfare. Due to their deceptive nature, the operations and the individuals who carried them out were notorious. When militaries had to resort to such inglorious operations they often relegated them to mercenaries or to second-rate soldiers.

### OBJECTIVES

- Structuring Unstructured Data. 
- Process Tracing

##### UNITS OF ANALYSIS

- Military Units
- Military Operations

### WORKFLOW

##### DATA GATHERING

I have completed this phase of the work. At this point I believe that we have enough unstructured data formatted as _OCR_. I use **Evernote** as my main tool for collecting and archiving unstructured data. However, for those of you who prefer to use **Notion**, I made a copy of all the documents to this tool as well.

##### DATA STRUCTURING 

We can use different tools to structure the data. Before we choose a particular tool we should consider the kind of data that we are looking for.
There are several software dedicated to creating timelines. After I explored them I reached the conclusion that working with such applications as our main tool would be unwise. Timelines feed off spreadsheets and CSV files. 
Hence, it would be easier to choose a spreadsheet and start the work from there.

**TIMELINE** 
- Unit _(text)_ Date _(mm,dd,yyyy)_.
- Event _(text)_ Date _(mm,dd,yyyy)_.

The key questions that we explore why did special operations forces gain legitimacy during the second world war, and to what extent have they served the purpose for which they were created. Both questions require meticulous and dynamic timeline.
First, we need to place each unit on the timeline of the second world war. Preferably, with the exact relevant dates.
Second, we have to place each event or operation in which the unit took part in the same timeline. 

**ACTORS** 
- Individuals _(text)_. 
- Organizations _(text)_.

**LOCATIONS** 
- City _(text)_, State _(text)_, Country _(text)_, Region _(text)_, Coordinates _(lon, lat)_.

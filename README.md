### PROJECT BACKGROUND

Special operations forces _(SOFs)_ had gained increasing prominence since the 1970s. When terrorists began to hijack civilian  airplanes, these clandestine units came out of the shadows and became synonymous with counterterrorism operations. Yet, terrorism was not the cause for the appearance of SOFs. 

Modern-day SOFs appeared at the onset of the Second World War. 

On June 3rd 1940 Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote to the Chief of Staff:

> "The completely defensive habit of mind, which has ruined the French, must not be allowed to ruin all our
initiative. It is of the highest consequence to keep the largest numbers of German forces all along the
coasts of the countries that have been conquered, and we should immediately set to work to organise
raiding forces on these coasts. Enterprises must be prepared with specially trained troops by the hunter
class, who can develop a reign of terror first of all on the “butcher and bolt” policy."

Since then they have constituted an integral part of the **transformation of modern warfare**. 

Indeed, in recent conflicts, SOFs have gradually replaced the infantry and other land army units and established themselves as the core branch of land warfare.

The rise of SOFs to prominence is far from obvious. Clandestine missions have always been part of warfare. Due to their deceptive nature, the operations and the individuals who carried them out were notorious. When militaries had to resort to such inglorious operations they often relegated them to mercenaries or to second-rate soldiers [ British commandos 1940 were second rate] 

The unceasing technological breakthroughs during and after WWI earned the era with the title ‘The Second Industrial Revolution.’ The tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, and heavy bombers that evolved during those years raised the stakes of each confrontation. 

As a result, military intelligence agencies had expanded and became increasingly attentive to technological changes in rival armed forces. However, gathering intelligence regarding enemies’ capabilities, let alone plans, was an arduous challenge.
